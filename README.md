Personal dotfiles of Joseph Lukasik

All the dotfiles stay in this folder, and symlinks are created where the
programs will be expecting them. Run `./install.sh` to create them.

If you are cloning this repo after a chromebook powerwash, run
`./chromebook-install.sh` to install all the packages that you need.
